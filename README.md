# Cognitive Safety Net – Geospatial-Based Recommender (Simplified)

A simplified WPF application using the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture, designed to support individuals in early-stage dementia. It allows collaborators to register their level of support, displays multimedia, and integrates basic social media functionality. XML is used for data storage, and LINQ is used for querying collaborator data.

## ✅ Core Features

1. 📝 **Collaborator Support Form**  
   - A WPF form interface for entering the support level of collaborators.  
   - Data is saved to an XML file.  
   - LINQ is used to query the collaborator data.

2. 🖼️ **Image and Text Display**  
   - WPF UI displays text and image content to the user.

3. 🌐 **Social Media Interaction**  
   - Integration with one social media stream (e.g., Twitter or Facebook) for posting status updates.

4. 🧪 **Unit Testing**  
   - Unit tests for core logic such as XML handling and LINQ queries.

5. 🧱 **Use of Design Principles**  
   - Clear separation of concerns via the **MVC architecture**:  
     - **Model**: Handles data (XML)
     - **View**: WPF UI
     - **Controller**: Manages interactions and logic flow
